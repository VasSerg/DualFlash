## Hello! This is my app's source code for Samsung Z Flip 5.  
  
This app allows to use both screens at one time while phone is unfolded. It sends funny images on the second display and allows to draw by hand, which is also displayed on the second screen.  
The app is customized only for sizes of Samsung Z Flip 5, but also should work for other foldable devices. However, the layout issues shure will be present.  
Code is written in Android Studio on kotlin, because the only official example of dualscreen usage is given on that language.
  
## You can download the app in releases page: https://github.com/VasSerg/DualFlash/releases/tag/v0.5
